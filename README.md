The AIME Floor Predictor is a Python-based tool designed to predict the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) floor scores for various AMC (American Mathematics Competitions) tests based on historical data from the years 2000 to 2023. Leveraging linear regression, the tool allows users to input a specific year and select an AMC test to receive a predicted AIME floor score, rounded to the nearest multiple of 1.5.
